 * Header file for the aes library. This implements AES as per the FIPS 197
 * specification. The constants defined below can be changed per that spec to
 * implement either AES-192 or AES-256; it currently implements AES-128 by
 * default.
 *
 * This library is a minimal implementation of the spec, with no helper
 * functions. The caller needs to manage parsing, padding, and loading data
 * into aes_state structs.
 *
 * This code conforms to ANSI C, and has no memory leaks according to Valgrind.
